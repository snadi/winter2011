= Configuration model files =
undertaker uses extracted configuration informations to check the code against them. The format of the model files is simple:

{{{
CONFIG_DOES_NOT_IMPLY_ANYTHING
CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG "(CONFIG_WATCHDOG && CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE) && !CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG_MODULE"
}}}

It's a column format where every column is enclosed in double quotes, with the exception that fields without spaces don't need to be quoted. The model format describes the semantic

{{{
COLUMN[0] â†’ COLUMN[1]
}}}

Where the first column '''must''' be a single symbol and the second one can be any boolean expression with '''&&, ||, !, (, )'''. It must be read as: If the symbol on the left is true, we can deduce, that the expression on the right must evaluate to true. If there is no second column it means, that we can't deduce anything from the symbol.

In our example we can read: "If CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG is true, we can deduce that CONFIG_WATCHDOG and CONFIG_FOOTBRIDGE is true and CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG_MODULE is false"

There are two kinds of specialities to the format: Lines with I: in the first column are comments. And lines with the ''magic'' symbol '''ALWAYS_ON''': Each column in this line is always set to true. This isn't exactly implemented in all parts of the undertaker right now, but will be used soon.

{{{
ALWAYS_ON "CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_CACHE_LINE_SIZE" "CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_CPU_IDLE_WAIT" "CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_CPU_RELAX"
}}}

= Configuration models for the Linux kernel =

Configuration models for the Linux kernel are generated by the helper script '''undertaker-kconfigdump''', which has to be called inside an linux tree. It will generate models for all architectures in the subfolder models.

Internally it will call first '''dumpconf''', a modified version of menuconfig, that will print out the information about the kconfig into a intermediate format. This format is then transformed with '''rsf2model''' into the model files, where all symbols, etc. are evaluated. rsf2model is the point where the kconfig semantic is converted in the above simple model of symbols and implications.
